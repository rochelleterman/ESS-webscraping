### About the Course

This course teaches students to acquire, process, and analyze data from the Internet using the R statistical programming language. The first portion of the class introduces tools to clean, transform, and wrangle data using `tidyverse` packages. We will also review key programming concepts and techniques to make the best use of R. In the second portion of the course, students will learn how to collect internet data in a variety of forms, including application programming interfaces (APIs) and scraping the open web. The third portion of the class focuses on analyzing the data weâ€™ve collected, introducing the basics of text analysis and visualization.
